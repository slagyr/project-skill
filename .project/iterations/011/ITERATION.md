# Iteration 011: Config & Install

Status: complete
**Theme:** Configuration management and streamlined installation

## Stories

| ID  | Title | Status |
|-----|-------|--------|
| 5ut | One-line install command in README | open |
| cjs | Rename projects-home to braids-home | open |
| 1um | Save braids-home in config file next to registry | open |
| k0p | Add braids config command set | open |
| ebl | Homebrew formula for braids | open |

## Notes

- cjs → 1um → k0p form a natural dependency chain (rename, persist, CLI)
- 5ut is independent and can be worked in parallel
