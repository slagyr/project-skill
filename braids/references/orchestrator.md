# Projects Orchestrator

You are the braids orchestrator. You do NOT perform bead work — you spawn workers that do.

**IMPORTANT:** Keep this session lightweight. Do not read large files or produce verbose output. Every token accumulates across cron runs.

## Steps

### 1. Gather Session Labels

Call `sessions_list` and collect all session labels. You'll need these for zombie detection.

### 2. Detect and Clean Up Zombies

From the session list, identify zombie sessions — worker sessions that should no longer count toward concurrency:

1. **Session not running** — status is `completed`, `failed`, `error`, `stopped`, etc.
2. **Bead already closed** — the bead id in the label (`project:<slug>:<bead-id>`) is closed (check via `bd show <bead-id>`)
3. **Excessive runtime** — running longer than the project's WorkerTimeout (default 1800s)

Always check bead status before applying runtime threshold. A long-running session on an open bead is probably still working.

For each zombie: exclude from worker count, kill the session via `sessions_kill`, and notify the project channel if `blocker` notifications are enabled: `"🧟 Cleaned up zombie worker session for <bead-id>"`

### 3. Run `braids orch-run`

Run the CLI command:

```
braids orch-run
```

This handles all the heavy lifting AND pre-formats spawn parameters. It outputs JSON with one of two shapes:

**Spawn result** (each entry is ready for `sessions_spawn`):
```json
{
  "action": "spawn",
  "spawns": [
    {
      "task": "You are a project worker...",
      "label": "project:my-project:my-project-abc",
      "runTimeoutSeconds": 1800,
      "cleanup": "delete",
      "thinking": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Idle result:**
```json
{
  "action": "idle",
  "reason": "no-active-iterations",
  "disable_cron": true
}
```

Possible idle reasons: `no-active-iterations`, `no-ready-beads`, `all-at-capacity`.

> **Note:** The CLI does not yet accept session labels as input, so worker counts default to 0. Zombie cleanup (Step 2) and concurrency limiting must still be handled by the orchestrator agent until the CLI supports session-label input.

### 4. Spawn Workers

For each entry in the `spawns` array, call `sessions_spawn` directly with the fields from the JSON:

```
sessions_spawn(
  task: <task>,
  label: <label>,
  runTimeoutSeconds: <runTimeoutSeconds>,
  cleanup: <cleanup>,
  thinking: <thinking>
)
```

No additional processing needed — the JSON entries map 1:1 to `sessions_spawn` parameters.

### 5. Self-Disable on Idle

If the result includes `"disable_cron": true`, disable the orchestrator cron job:

1. Run `openclaw cron delete <cron-id>` to remove the orchestrator cron job
2. Notify each project channel (if `no-ready-beads` notification is enabled) that the orchestrator is going idle
3. The orchestrator will not run again until manually re-activated

This ensures **zero token usage** during idle periods. To re-activate, set up the cron job again (see SKILL.md § Cron Integration).

### 6. Done

Do not do any bead work yourself. Just spawn and exit.

## Troubleshooting

### Context Overflow

If this cron session hits "context overflow", the accumulated transcript is too large. Fix:

```bash
# Find the cron job id
openclaw cron list --json

# Delete and recreate with a fresh session
openclaw cron rm <job-id>
openclaw cron add \
  --name "braids-orchestrator" \
  --every 5m \
  --session isolated \
  --message "You are the braids orchestrator. Read and follow ~/.openclaw/skills/braids/references/orchestrator.md" \
  --timeout-seconds 300 \
  --no-deliver
```
