# Braids

Autonomous background project management for OpenClaw agents. Enables long-running projects with iterative delivery, parallel sub-agent execution, and structured check-ins.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/slagyr/braids.git
ln -s "$(pwd)/braids/braids" ~/.openclaw/skills/braids
```

That's it. Your agent can now follow [`references/init.md`](braids/references/init.md) to complete setup (verify dependencies, create braids home, configure the orchestrator cron, and scaffold your first project).

## Details

See [SKILL.md](braids/SKILL.md) for the full workflow, configuration, and reference docs.
