# Discord Channel Naming Should Be Flexible (projects-skill-5c9)

## Summary
Updated SKILL.md to make channel naming a suggestion rather than a prescribed convention.

## Details
- Renamed section from "Discord Channel for Check-ins" to "Channel for Check-ins" (platform-agnostic)
- Changed from prescribing `project-<slug>` format to suggesting any descriptive name
- Made category placement optional instead of required
- Clarified that the Channel field accepts any channel id or name
