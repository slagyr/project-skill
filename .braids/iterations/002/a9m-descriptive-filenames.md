# Use Descriptive Filenames for Story Deliverables (projects-skill-a9m)

## Summary
Updated SKILL.md and worker.md to document the new deliverable filename convention: `<id-suffix>-<descriptive-name>.md` where `<id-suffix>` is the last 3 characters of the bead id and `<descriptive-name>` is a short kebab-case summary.

## Details
- Changed directory layout example from `<story-id>.md` to `<id-suffix>-<name>.md`
- Updated the Story Deliverables section with full explanation and example
- Updated the workflow section's inline reference
- Updated worker.md to match the new convention
- Iteration 001 files left as-is (completed iteration is immutable)
- Iteration 002 already had some files using the new convention (`isc-planning-status.md`, `nkx-standardize-worker-terminology.md`)
