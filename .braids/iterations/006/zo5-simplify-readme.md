# Simplify README.md Install

## Summary

Simplified README.md from a multi-step manual setup guide down to two commands: `git clone` + `ln -s`. Removed all manual `mkdir`, `cat`, registry creation, and requirements sections. The README now points to `references/init.md` for full agent-driven setup and `SKILL.md` for details.

## Changes

- **README.md**: Replaced verbose 4-step manual install with 2-command install (clone + symlink). Removed Requirements and Usage/Create a Project sections. Added link to init.md for automated setup and SKILL.md for details.
