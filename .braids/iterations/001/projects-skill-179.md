# Update Skill: Project Channels Are Planning-Only (projects-skill-179)

## Summary
Updated SKILL.md to clarify that project Discord channels are for planning and notifications only. All actual work happens asynchronously via beads and the cron worker.

## Details
Added explicit language to the "Discord Channel for Check-ins" section stating that channels are planning-only surfaces. This prevents confusion about where work happens — it's always async via the worker, never in the channel conversation.

## Assets
None.
