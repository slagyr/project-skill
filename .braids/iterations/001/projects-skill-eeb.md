# REVIEW.md Only for Blockers/Questions (projects-skill-eeb)

## Summary
Updated SKILL.md to clarify that REVIEW.md should only be created when there are blockers or questions needing customer input, not for routine progress summaries.

## Details
Previously, the "Preparing for Check-in" section implied creating REVIEW.md before every review with progress summaries, demo points, etc. Updated to:
- REVIEW.md is only for blockers, questions, and proposed direction changes
- Routine progress is visible through story deliverables and `bd list`
- This reduces noise and keeps check-ins focused on decisions

## Assets
None.
