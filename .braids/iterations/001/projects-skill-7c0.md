# Replace 'Zane' with 'OpenClaw' throughout project files (projects-skill-7c0)

## Summary
Replaced agent-specific name "Zane" with generic "OpenClaw agents" in PROJECT.md goal section.

## Details
Only one occurrence found: in PROJECT.md's Goal section. Changed "enables Zane to work" to "enables OpenClaw agents to work" to keep the skill generic and not tied to a specific agent identity.
