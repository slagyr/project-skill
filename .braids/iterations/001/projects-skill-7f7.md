# Update Skill: No Work During Iteration Meetings (projects-skill-7f7)

## Summary
Updated SKILL.md to clarify that during check-in meetings, the agent should only create beads and plan iterations — not perform project work. Work happens between meetings via the autonomous cron worker.

## Details
Added guidance to the Discord channel section: "During check-in meetings in the channel, the agent should only create beads and plan iterations — not do project work." This enforces the async-first workflow and keeps meetings focused on planning.

## Assets
None.
