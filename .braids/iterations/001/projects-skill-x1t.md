# Add Discord Channel Creation for Project Check-ins (projects-skill-x1t)

## Summary
Updated SKILL.md to include Discord channel creation as part of the project creation workflow. Each project gets a dedicated `project-<slug>` channel for notifications and check-ins.

## Details
Added two new sections to SKILL.md:

1. **Updated "Creating a Project"** — Added steps 5-6 for creating a Discord channel and recording its id in PROJECT.md
2. **New "Discord Channel for Check-ins"** section — Documents the channel naming convention (`project-<slug>`), category organization ("Projects"), topic setting, and what notifications the channel receives

The channel serves as the single notification surface for:
- Iteration completion announcements
- Blocker/question alerts requiring human input
- Check-in review summaries

## Assets
None.
