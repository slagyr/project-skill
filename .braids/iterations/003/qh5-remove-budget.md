# Remove Budget from PROJECT.md format and all docs (projects-skill-qh5)

## Summary
Removed the `Budget` field from PROJECT.md, SKILL.md format template, and SKILL.md directory layout comment.

## Details
Budget can't be meaningfully enforced — no reliable cumulative cost/token tracking is available. Removed all references:

1. **PROJECT.md** — Removed `Budget: unlimited` line
2. **SKILL.md** — Removed `Budget: unlimited | <constraint>` from the PROJECT.md format template
3. **SKILL.md** — Updated directory layout comment from "Goals, guardrails, autonomy, budget" to "Goals, guardrails, autonomy"

One historical reference remains in `iterations/001/projects-skill-tn1.md` (a closed deliverable) — left untouched since completed iterations are immutable.
