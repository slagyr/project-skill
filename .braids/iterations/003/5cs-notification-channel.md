# Set up a notification channel for projects-skill project (projects-skill-5cs)

## Summary
Verified and confirmed the Discord notification channel for the projects-skill project is fully operational.

## Details
- **Channel:** `#projects-skill` (ID: `1471680593497554998`)
- **Guild:** `1471611817712418918`
- **Topic:** "Build and refine the autonomous project management skill for OpenClaw agents"
- **Parent category:** `1471680561604071628`

The channel was already created and configured in PROJECT.md's `Channel` field. Verified by:
1. Successfully sending a bead-start notification to the channel
2. Confirming channel-info returns correct metadata and topic

No further setup needed — all notification events (bead-start, bead-complete, iteration-complete, etc.) are configured as `on` in PROJECT.md and the channel is receiving messages.
