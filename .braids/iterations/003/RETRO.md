# Iteration 003 Retrospective

## Summary
Iteration 003 focused on hardening the projects skill: improving the orchestrator/worker architecture, adding error handling, dependency management, notification infrastructure, multi-project support, and developer experience features like a progress dashboard and auto-retrospectives. All 12 stories were completed successfully with no blockers.

## Completed
| Bead | Title | Deliverable |
|------|-------|-------------|
| projects-skill-uu0 | Cron worker is orchestrator only — spawns workers, does no bead work | uu0-orchestrator-refactor.md |
| projects-skill-xrv | Workers must read PROJECT.md and AGENTS.md on startup | xrv-worker-startup-context.md |
| projects-skill-qh5 | Remove Budget from PROJECT.md format and all docs | qh5-remove-budget.md |
| projects-skill-hc7 | Fix PROJECT.md settings rendering | hc7-fix-settings-rendering.md |
| projects-skill-z15 | Formalize worker error handling and escalation path | z15-worker-error-handling.md |
| projects-skill-5cs | Set up a notification channel for projects-skill project | 5cs-notification-channel.md |
| projects-skill-fqr | Support skill migration command via project channel | fqr-skill-migration-command.md |
| projects-skill-463 | Handle skill updates gracefully across existing projects | 463-graceful-skill-updates.md |
| projects-skill-4bq | Worker should explicitly handle bead dependency chains | 4bq-worker-dependency-chains.md |
| projects-skill-qc0 | Validate multi-project support with concurrent active projects | qc0-validate-multi-project.md |
| projects-skill-1xn | Add progress dashboard: auto-generate STATUS.md across all projects | 1xn-progress-dashboard.md |
| projects-skill-9yv | Auto-generate iteration retrospective on completion | 9yv-auto-retro.md |

## Key Decisions
- Orchestrator/worker split: cron job only orchestrates, never does bead work directly
- Workers load PROJECT.md and AGENTS.md before any work for consistent guardrail enforcement
- Format compatibility via worker tolerance (missing fields → defaults) plus user-triggered migration for intentional updates
- Dependency verification added as explicit worker step to catch race conditions
- Error handling formalized into recoverable/blocker/question categories with clear escalation
- Progress dashboard (STATUS.md) auto-generated at PROJECTS_HOME level across all projects
- Retrospectives auto-generated as RETRO.md on iteration completion

## Lessons Learned
- The skill is now self-hosting effectively — using itself as the guinea pig caught real issues
- Breaking work into small, focused beads with clear deliverables keeps iterations clean
- Notification infrastructure (channel setup + configurable events) was worth the investment for visibility

## Carry-Forward
- No blocked or incomplete beads from this iteration
- Potential future work: richer dashboard formatting, retrospective customization, automated iteration planning suggestions
