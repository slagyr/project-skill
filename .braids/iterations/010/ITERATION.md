# Iteration 010

Status: complete

## Stories
- projects-skill-b9p: braids init: first-time setup
- projects-skill-4kp: braids new: interactive project creation

## Guardrails
- TDD: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR for every feature
- git pull before making changes
- All specs must pass with `bb test` before closing any bead
- Both commands are user-facing — prioritize clear output and good error messages
- braids init should work on a completely fresh machine (no existing config)
- braids new should generate valid project.edn and AGENTS.md from the start

## Notes
- Theme: onboarding — making it easy for new users to get started
- Last iteration of the CLI epic!
