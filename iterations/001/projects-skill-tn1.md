# Display project settings as a list in PROJECT.md (projects-skill-tn1)

## Summary
Verified PROJECT.md settings are already on separate lines. No changes needed.

## Details
PROJECT.md already displays Status, Priority, Budget, Autonomy, Checkin, and MaxAgents each on their own line. The SKILL.md template also reflects this format. Closed as already resolved.
