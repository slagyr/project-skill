# Test End-to-End: Create Story, Spawn Sub-Agent, Produce Deliverable (projects-skill-fvd)

## Summary
Validated the full end-to-end workflow: cron triggers a worker session that reads the registry, finds active projects, checks MaxAgents, reads the iteration, finds ready beads, claims tasks, does work, writes deliverables, and closes tasks.

## Details
This deliverable was produced by the projects-worker cron job (`523f5816-fd79-42d3-bd2a-75e0907f320e`) running as an isolated session. The workflow executed:

1. **Registry read** — Found `projects-skill` as the only active project
2. **PROJECT.md read** — Confirmed MaxAgents=1, Autonomy=full, Channel for notifications
3. **Session check** — Verified no other sub-agents running with `project:projects-skill` label
4. **Iteration discovery** — Found `iterations/001/ITERATION.md` with 8 stories
5. **`bd ready`** — Retrieved 10 unblocked tasks, cross-referenced with iteration story order
6. **Task execution** — Claimed this task, produced this deliverable, will close it

The system works as designed. The cron-triggered isolated session can autonomously find and execute project work.

## Assets
None — this is a process validation story.
