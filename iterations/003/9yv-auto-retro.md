# Auto-generate iteration retrospective on completion (projects-skill-9yv)

## Summary
Added automatic retrospective generation when an iteration completes. Workers now generate `RETRO.md` in the iteration directory as part of the completion flow.

## Details
- **worker.md**: Added step 8 "Generate Iteration Retrospective" with full format template and guidelines. Updated step 7 to call retrospective generation before marking iteration complete.
- **SKILL.md**: Updated directory layout to show `RETRO.md`. Added note in "Iteration Transitions" explaining auto-generation.

### Retrospective Format
The RETRO.md includes: Summary, Completed beads table, Blocked/Incomplete (if any), Key Decisions, Lessons Learned, and Carry-Forward items. Designed to be concise and useful for check-ins and future planning.

### Design Decisions
- Retrospective is generated by the worker that closes the last bead (not the orchestrator), since the worker already checks iteration completion in step 7
- Format uses tables for completed/blocked beads for scannability
- Sections like "Blocked/Incomplete" are omitted when empty to keep it clean
- Worker reviews all deliverables and bead metadata to populate the retrospective

## Assets
None.
