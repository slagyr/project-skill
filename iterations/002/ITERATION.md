# Iteration 002

- **Status:** complete

## Stories
- projects-skill-a9m: Use descriptive filenames for story deliverables
- projects-skill-3yu: Update cron example in SKILL.md to 5 min interval
- projects-skill-a2z: Document agent spawning strategy in SKILL.md
- projects-skill-w9g: Extract worker orchestration into projects/references/worker.md
- projects-skill-7c0: Replace 'Zane' with 'OpenClaw' throughout project files
- projects-skill-tn1: Display project settings as a list in PROJECT.md
- projects-skill-179: Update skill: project channels are planning-only, all work is async via beads
- projects-skill-7f7: Update skill: no work during iteration meetings, only bead creation
- projects-skill-isc: Add 'planning' status for iterations
- projects-skill-nkx: Standardize terminology: use 'worker' not 'agent'
- projects-skill-5c9: Discord channel naming should be flexible, not prescribed
- projects-skill-9bd: Add configurable notification table to PROJECT.md

## Guardrails
- Deliverable filenames use new convention: <last-3-chars>-<descriptive-name>.md
- No direct work in channels — beads only

## Notes
- Several beads carried over from iteration 001 that the worker may have already completed. Verify status before working.
