# CONTRACTS.md — System Invariants

This document defines the invariants that the orchestrator, worker, and file formats must uphold. Tests and agents should use these as the source of truth for correctness.

---

## 1. File Format Contracts

### 1.1 registry.md

- **Location:** `$PROJECTS_HOME/registry.md`
- **Required columns:** Slug, Status, Priority, Path
- **Valid statuses:** `active`, `paused`, `blocked` (never `complete`)
- **Slug uniqueness:** No two rows share the same Slug
- **Path validity:** Each Path must point to an existing directory containing `PROJECT.md`

### 1.2 PROJECT.md

- **Location:** `<project-root>/PROJECT.md`
- **Required fields:** Status, Priority, Autonomy (all others have defaults)
- **Defaults when missing:**
  - `MaxWorkers` → 1
  - `WorkerTimeout` → 3600
  - `Autonomy` → full
  - `Priority` → normal
  - `Checkin` → on-demand
  - `Channel` → none (skip notifications silently)
  - `Notifications` table → all events `on`
- **Valid values:**
  - Status: `active`, `paused`, `blocked`
  - Priority: `high`, `normal`, `low`
  - Autonomy: `full`, `ask-first`, `research-only`
  - Checkin: `daily`, `weekly`, `on-demand`
  - MaxWorkers: positive integer
  - WorkerTimeout: positive integer (seconds)
- **Unknown fields:** Ignored (never error)
- **Notification events:** `iteration-start`, `bead-start`, `bead-complete`, `iteration-complete`, `no-ready-beads`, `question`, `blocker`

### 1.3 ITERATION.md

- **Location:** `<project-root>/iterations/<N>/ITERATION.md`
- **Required fields:** Status
- **Valid statuses:** `planning`, `active`, `complete`
- **At most one active iteration per project** at any time
- **Immutability:** Once status is `complete`, the iteration directory must not be modified
- **Stories list:** Each entry is a bead id followed by a colon and title
- **Optional sections:** Guardrails, Notes (default: none)

### 1.4 Deliverable Files

- **Location:** `iterations/<N>/<id-suffix>-<descriptive-name>.md`
- **Naming:** `<id-suffix>` = last 3 characters of bead id; `<descriptive-name>` = short kebab-case summary
- **One deliverable per bead** per iteration
- **Required sections:** Summary (at minimum)

### 1.5 RETRO.md

- **Location:** `iterations/<N>/RETRO.md`
- **Created:** Only when an iteration completes (all stories closed)
- **Required sections:** Summary, Completed table
- **Optional sections:** Blocked/Incomplete, Key Decisions, Lessons Learned, Carry-Forward

### 1.6 STATUS.md

- **Location:** `$PROJECTS_HOME/STATUS.md`
- **Auto-generated:** Overwritten every orchestrator run; never hand-edit
- **Contains:** Timestamp, per-project summary with iteration status and bead counts

### 1.7 .orchestrator-state.json

- **Location:** `$PROJECTS_HOME/.orchestrator-state.json`
- **Fields:** `idleSince` (ISO timestamp or null), `idleReason` (string or null), `lastRunAt` (ISO timestamp)
- **Valid idleReasons:** `no-active-iterations`, `no-ready-beads`, `all-at-capacity`, or null

## 2. Orchestrator Invariants

### 2.1 No Direct Work
The orchestrator **never** performs bead work. It only reads state and spawns workers.

### 2.2 Concurrency Enforcement
For each project, the number of healthy (non-zombie) running workers must never exceed `MaxWorkers`.

### 2.3 Active Iteration Required
Workers are only spawned for projects that have exactly one iteration with `Status: active`.

### 2.4 Spawn Message Format
Worker spawn messages contain exactly four fields: `Project`, `Bead`, `Iteration`, `Channel`. Nothing more.

### 2.5 Session Label Convention
Workers are spawned with label `project:<slug>:<bead-id>`. The orchestrator uses the `project:<slug>` prefix to count active workers per project.

### 2.6 Zombie Cleanup Priority
Zombie detection criteria are evaluated in this order:
1. Non-running session status → exclude from count
2. Bead already closed → kill session
3. Runtime exceeds `WorkerTimeout` → kill session

Always check bead status before applying runtime threshold.

### 2.7 Frequency Scaling
- Workers spawned → clear idle state (`idleSince` = null)
- No workers spawned → set/preserve `idleSince`, set `idleReason`
- `idleSince` is only set when transitioning from non-idle to idle; preserved across consecutive idle runs
- Backoff intervals: `no-active-iterations` = 30min, `no-ready-beads` = 15min, `all-at-capacity` = 10min

### 2.8 Status Dashboard
STATUS.md is regenerated at the end of every full orchestrator run (not skipped runs).

## 3. Worker Invariants

### 3.1 Context Loading Order
Workers must read context in this order before any work:
1. PROJECT.md
2. Workspace AGENTS.md (`~/.openclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md`)
3. Project AGENTS.md
4. ITERATION.md for the assigned iteration

### 3.2 Claim Before Work
A worker must successfully `bd update <bead-id> --claim` before starting any work. If the claim fails, stop immediately.

### 3.3 Dependency Verification
After claiming, the worker verifies all direct dependencies are closed. If any are open, the bead is marked `blocked` and work stops. Transitive dependencies are not checked (handled by `bd ready`).

### 3.4 Deliverable Required
Every completed bead produces a deliverable file in the iteration directory.

### 3.5 Close After Deliverable
Beads are closed only after the deliverable is written. Sequence: work → write deliverable → `bd update -s closed` → git commit.

### 3.6 Git Commit on Completion
Every bead closure includes a git commit. Format: `"<summary> (<bead-id>)"`.

### 3.7 Iteration Completion Check
After closing a bead, the worker checks if the iteration is complete. If so, it must first acquire the `.completing` lock file (`iterations/<N>/.completing`). Only the first worker to create this file proceeds with RETRO.md generation, ITERATION.md update, commit, and notification. If `.completing` already exists, the worker must skip iteration completion entirely. This ensures only one worker completes an iteration even when multiple beads close simultaneously.

### 3.8 Notification Discipline
Workers only send notifications for events that are `on` in the project's Notifications table. If `Channel` is missing, all notifications are silently skipped.

### 3.9 Format Tolerance
Workers never fail due to missing or unknown fields in PROJECT.md or ITERATION.md. Missing fields use defaults; unknown fields are ignored.

### 3.10 Error Escalation
- Recoverable errors: retry once, try alternatives, then escalate
- Blockers: mark bead `blocked`, notify, stop
- Questions: notify, continue other work if possible
- Guardrail conflicts: never violate; block and escalate
- Partial completion: write partial deliverable, block with context

### 3.11 Autonomy Respect
Workers with `ask-first` autonomy must confirm via Channel before executing. `full` autonomy workers execute freely. `research-only` workers only gather information.

## 4. Cross-Cutting Invariants

### 4.1 Path Convention
`~` always resolves to the user's home directory, never the agent workspace. Project files are never created inside `~/.openclaw/workspace/`.

### 4.2 PROJECTS_HOME Resolution
`PROJECTS_HOME` defaults to `~/Projects`. Checked once per session from registry or default.

### 4.3 Single Source of Truth
- What to work on → `bd ready` (not manual lists)
- Project config → PROJECT.md (not SKILL.md at runtime)
- Iteration state → ITERATION.md
- Bead state → `bd` commands

### 4.4 Git as Transport
All project work is committed and pushed. Work is not complete until `git push` succeeds.

### 4.5 Completed Iterations Are Immutable
No modifications to iterations with `Status: complete` — files, ITERATION.md, deliverables, RETRO.md are all frozen.

### 4.6 Bead Lifecycle
Valid bead state transitions: `open` → `in_progress` (claim) → `closed` | `blocked`. Blocked beads can be reopened. Closed beads are final.
